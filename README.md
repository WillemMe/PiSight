A primative Raspberry Pi Camera 
PiSight is an atempt to use a raspberry Pi as an camera. With as main features being able to make timelapeses and GIF's.

## Motivation

This was my second electronics and software combined project. My goal was to create something using a Raspberry Pi (zero). 
Eventualy I wanted to create a camera, strongly inspired by [PIX-E Gif camera](https://www.hackster.io/nick-brewer/pix-e-gif-camera-323965 "PIX-E GIF camera project").


### Learning goals:
* Further Node.js
* Further API
* Electronics (buttons, battery, screen etc.)
* Socket.io (image stream)
* 3D design (Fusion 360)
* 3D printing
